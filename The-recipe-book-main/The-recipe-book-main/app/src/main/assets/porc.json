      "Instructions": "I started by preparing the ham for boiling. Yes, it needs to boil for a while. I tied the ham tightly (with some help from my husband), just like in the picture. Then, in a pressure cooker, I placed the rolled ham, enough water to cover it, peeled and sliced the carrots, and quartered the onion. I also added the crushed pepper, coriander seeds, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaves. I let everything simmer for about an hour and a half.\n\nThe next step was to remove the skin, score the ham, and insert cloves here and there.\n\nTo prepare the caramel sauce, I preheated the oven to 170°C and started the brown sugar sauce. Here's what I did: in a small pot, I placed all the ingredients and let them cook over medium heat until the sugar melted, and the sauce foamed. The entire process took about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally but keep an eye on it, as it can easily overflow. Once the sauce was ready, I coated the ham with this wonderful sauce and placed it in the oven.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, I took it out, coated it with half of the caramel sauce, and returned it to the oven for another 35 minutes.\n\nIt was done when the surface became golden and slightly crispy. After removing it from the oven, I let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing. The taste is divine, balanced with cinnamon and cloves, subtle but not overpowering. It pairs wonderfully with a good glass of red wine."

I poured the dark beer over everything. The 600 ml should cover the vegetables but not the meat. I added bay leaves and peppercorns, covered the pot (very important, or the beer will evaporate and the meat will dry out), and cooked it in the oven at 150°C for 4.5 hours.\n\nOnce cooked, I transferred it to a grill on a baking tray, raised the temperature to 220°C, and let it cook for 10-15 minutes to get a golden crust.\n\nMeanwhile, I prepared the dark beer sauce by straining the liquid from the pot, simmering it, and reducing it by half. I blended the cooked vegetables into the sauce, and after 15 minutes, the sauce was ready. I garnished the pork belly with thyme and served it with crispy potatoes and green beans."
