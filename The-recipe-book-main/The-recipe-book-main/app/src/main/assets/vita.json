			"Instructions": "I started by taking the meat out of the fridge 40 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. I washed and dried the beef shank with paper towels to ensure it had a dry surface. I heated a pan with some oil on medium-high heat and dusted the beef with flour. I tied the meat to keep it compact, then seared it on both sides until golden brown. I added butter, garlic cloves, and aromatic herbs to the pan and let them cook for a minute. I preheated the oven to 170℃. I placed the seared meat in a heatproof dish with the broth, green onions, parsnip, carrots, celery, and some water to cover the meat slightly. I covered the dish with aluminum foil and cooked it for 2 hours."

I baked the beef in the oven at 170℃ for about 10 minutes until the center temperature reached 50℃. Once out of the oven, I brushed the beef with Dijon mustard while still hot, wrapped it tightly in cling film, and refrigerated it for 15 minutes. I chopped mushrooms finely and sautéed them with red onion in olive oil. I laid out a sheet of cling film, placed thin ham slices overlapping slightly, spread the mushroom mixture on top, and wrapped the beef in this layer. After refrigerating again, I wrapped the beef in puff pastry, brushed it with egg wash, and baked it at 200℃ for about an hour until the pastry turned golden. After resting for 15 minutes, it was ready to serve."

I served the beef ribs with the celery puree, roasted carrots, and pickled beets."
