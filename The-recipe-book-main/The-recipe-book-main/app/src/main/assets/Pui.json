I cooked them until they turned golden brown. Meanwhile, I sliced the red onion and chicken breast into strips.\n\nOnce the mushrooms were golden, I added the onion and chicken to the pan. I sautéed them for about 6 minutes before adding the cream, water, mustard, and minced garlic. I let everything simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes until the sauce thickened. I seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. \n\nI served this seasonal dish with toasted bread and sprinkled some rosemary on top."

In the last 10 minutes, I used the oven's ventilation function to create a crisp, golden crust.\n\nFor the creamy mashed potatoes, I boiled the potatoes in salted water until tender, drained them, and mashed them with hot milk and butter. The texture was silky and airy.\n\nI served the chicken whole, allowing everyone to pick their favorite pieces, alongside the mashed potatoes and cherry compote. It was a nostalgic, heartwarming family meal."
